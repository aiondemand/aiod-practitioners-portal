/**
 * A technique or technology used in a [[Dataset]] (or [[DataDownload]], [[DataCatalog]]), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (described using [[variableMeasured]]). This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but rather as a high level summary for dataset discovery. For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: \"mass spectrometry\" or \"nmr spectroscopy\" or \"colorimetry\" or \"immunofluorescence\". If the [[variableMeasured]] is \"depression rating\", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be \"Zung Scale\" or \"HAM-D\" or \"Beck Depression Inventory\". If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]].
