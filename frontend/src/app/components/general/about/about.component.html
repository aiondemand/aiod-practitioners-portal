        <p>
            RAIL is a tool that allows AI practitioners to explore and use AI assets directly in AIoD.
            RAIL is developed within the <a href="https://ai4europe.eu" target="_blank">AI4Europe project</a> as one of the core services of the <a href="https://ai4europe.eu" target="_blank">AI on Demand platform.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            More extensively, RAIL:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is a web application</li>
            <li>… that enables <b>AI practitioners</b></li>
            <li>… to <b>work with AIoD AI Assets</b> (explore, search, compare, …)</li>
            <li>… and <b>create experiments</b> that are reproducible and reusable</li>
            <li>… that are <b>executable directly in the AIoD platform</b> supported by its infrastructure</li>
            <li>… and that <b>make use of AIoD AI Assets</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Important note:</b> RAIL is currently in the beta version. It is likely that you will encounter bugs and other issues. Please, report them to us using the feedback button on the left.

        <h2>Explore AI Assets available in AIoD</h2>
        <p>
            Currently, RAIL supports the exploration of <a [routerLink]="['/datasets', 'all']" routerLinkActive="router-link-active"> AI Datasets</a> that are available in the AI on Demand platform.
            In the future releases, 
        </p>

        <h2>Compose AI assets available in AIoD into executable experiments</h2>
        <p>
            RAIL allows AI practitioners to compose AI assets available in AIoD into executable experiments.
            The experiments are composed of AI assets that are available in AIoD and are executed in the AIoD platform.
            The experiments are reproducible and reusable.
        </p>
        <p>
            RAIL introduces two main concepts that allow you to create and run reproducible and reusable experiments: 
        </p>

        <h3>Experiment template</h3>
        <p>
            <a [routerLink]="['/experiments', 'templates', 'all']">Experiment template</a> is a combination of <i>runtime environment</i>, <i>software dependencies</i> and <i>code</i>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Runtime environment</b> is a specification of the environment in which the experiment is executed. It includes the specification of the hardware and software environment.</li>
            <li><b>Software dependencies</b> are the software packages that are required to execute the experiment.</li>
            <li><b>Code</b> is the code that is executed in the experiment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See "<a [routerLink]="['/experiments', 'templates', 'create']">Create a template</a>" section for more details.</p>
        <p>
            Experiment template on its own is not executable. You need to create and Experiment based on a template to be able to execute it.
            The Experiment defines particular parameters that are injected into the Template through Environment variables to make it executable.
            These include AI Assets, environment variables supported by the author of the template (they are defined by the author), and other parameters.
        </p>

        <h3>Experiment</h3>
        <p>
            <a [routerLink]="['/experiments', 'all']">Experiment</a> is an particular executable instance of an Experiment template. Experiments are composed of AI assets and are executed in the AIoD platform. Experiments are reproducible and reusable.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you create an experiment, you select an Experiment template that you want to use as a basis for your experiment. Then, you select particular AI assets and values of environment variables that you want to use in your experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you execute an experiment, the following happens under the hood:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>An instance of Experiment Run is created (it is available in the Experiment detail page).</li>
            <li>A Docker image specified by the linked Experiment template with all the software dependencies installed is created.</li>
            <li>A Docker container is started. AI Assets and environment variables are available globally in the container.</li>
            <li>srcipt.py is executed.</li>
            <li>After the Run finishes, the Docker logs and metrics (if any) are available on the detail of the Run.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>See "<a [routerLink]="['/experiments', 'create']">Create an experiment</a>" section for more details.</p>
