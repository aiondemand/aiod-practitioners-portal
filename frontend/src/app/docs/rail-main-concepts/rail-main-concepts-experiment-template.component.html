    <h1>Experiment Template</h1>

    <h2>What is Experiment template</h2>
    <p>
        Experiment template is a combination of runtime environment, software dependencies and code.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Runtime environment</b> is a specification of the environment in which the experiment is executed. In
            RAIL, it is a specific Docker image.</li>
        <li><b>Software dependencies</b> are the software packages that are required to execute the experiment.
            Currently, <code>requirements.txt</code> file with Python dependencies is supported.</li>
        <li><b>Code</b> is the code that is executed in the experiment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How can I use Experiment template</h2>
    <p>
        Experiment template on its own is not executable. You need to create an <a
            [routerLink]="['/docs', 'main-concepts-experiment']">Experiment</a> based on a specific template to be able
        to execute it. The Experiment defines particular parameters that are injected into the Template through
        Environment variables to make it executable. These include AI model, dataset (their name and AIoD ID) and
        environment variables supported by the template (they are defined by the author).
